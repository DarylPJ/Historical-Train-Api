# Historical-Train-Api
This is an api to make the request and response of the national rail historic train data easier to use. https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/HSP 

this formed the backend to the [ui repo](https://github.com/DarylPJ/HistoricalTrains). Together these formed an app to tell you when your train was and the reason for its delay. This api used to be hosted on expo and now is unused.
